## Professional Accounts (2 hours)

Download and install the following software or register for the apps.

Click on the links to go to the registration pages. Keep your login details for all sites/apps consistent and always use your real name.

{{<note type="info" title="Real Name" >}}

### Gmail, Google Account

Make a new Google account if you do not have a professional one already. Use your real name. Don‚Äôt use any numbers or words that are not your name. Never put the year of your birth in your professional email address. Your email address should look something like this:
