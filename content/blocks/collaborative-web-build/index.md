In this workshop, participants will work collaboratively in teams to create a fully functional website. Each team member will be responsible for developing a specific section of the website, allowing them to focus on individual tasks while contributing to the collective project. The workshop will emphasize the use of GitHub for version control and collaboration, as each participant will commit their work to a shared repository. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of collaborative development, GitHub workflows, and how different components come together to form a cohesive website.
