This interactive workshop is designed to help participants identify the learning methods that work best for them. Through guided activities and assessments, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of their unique learning preferences. The instructor will provide resources and conduct tests to reveal individual strengths and learning styles, whether visual, auditory, reading/writing, or kinesthetic. By the end of the workshop, each participant will have a clear understanding of their preferred learning style, along with practical strategies to enhance their study habits and overall performance.
