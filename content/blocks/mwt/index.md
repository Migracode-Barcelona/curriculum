## Use this time wisely üéØ

To make the most out of this workshop and ensure you're getting the best value, here are a few tips to keep in mind that will help you stay focused, collaborate effectively, and leave with actionable insights:

- **Come Prepared:** Come Prepared beforehand and gather your thoughts on the specific areas where you need clarification or support. This ensures you ask targeted questions during the workshop.

- **Engage Actively:** Don‚Äôt just observe ask questions, share your experiences, and participate in discussions. Workshops are most valuable when everyone collaborates.

- **Collaborate with Peers:** If you see a fellow participant struggling with a topic you‚Äôre comfortable with, offer your help. Peer learning enhances the overall experience for everyone.

- **Apply Immediately:** After the workshop, try to implement what you‚Äôve learned in your course work or personal projects. Practical application reinforces your learning.

- **Follow-Up:** If a topic wasn‚Äôt fully covered or you still have doubts, follow up with your instructor or peers after the session. This ensures no questions are left unanswered.
